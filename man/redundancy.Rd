\title{Redundancy index (Ricotta & Pavoine 2025)}
\usage{
redundancy(ab, diss)
}
\arguments{
\item{ab}{A numeric vector of element abundances.}

\item{diss}{A numeric matrix of pairwise dissimilarities among elements
scaled in [0, 1]. Must be square with dimension equal to length of \code{ab}.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing functional redundancy, \eqn{Re = D - Q}.
}
\description{
Computes functional redundancy as the difference between Simpson's diversity
(probability that two randomly drawn individuals are of different species)
and Rao's quadratic entropy based on a supplied dissimilarity matrix.
}
\details{
Formally: \eqn{Re = D - Q}, where \eqn{D = 1 - \sum_i p_i^2} is Simpson's
index and \eqn{Q = \sum_{i,j} p_i \, p_j \, \delta_{ij}} is Rao's quadratic
entropy. This redundancy measure is mathematically fixed to \eqn{q = 2}
because both components (Simpson and Rao) belong to the Simpsonâ€“Rao family
of quadratic diversity indices.
