\title{Convert Matrix Indices to Distance Vector Position}
\usage{
convert_to_dist_indices(i, j, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{i}{Integer vector of row indices (should be less than \code{j})}

\item{j}{Integer vector of column indices (should be greater than \code{i})}

\item{n}{Integer, the size of the square distance matrix (number of objects)}
}
\value{
Integer vector of the same length as \code{i} and \code{j}, containing the
positions in the distance vector corresponding to the input matrix indices.
}
\description{
Converts row and column indices from a full distance matrix to the corresponding
position in the compact vector representation used by R's \code{dist} objects.
This function maps \verb{(i, j)} matrix coordinates to the linear index \code{k} in the
lower-triangular distance vector.
}
\details{
R's \code{dist} objects store distance matrices in a compact form by only storing
the lower triangle (excluding the diagonal) as a vector. The storage order follows:
\itemize{
\item Row-major order of the lower triangle: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), ...
\item For an n×n matrix, the vector has length n×(n-1)/2
\item The formula used is: \eqn{k = (i-1) \times n - \frac{(i-1) \times i}{2} + (j-i)} for \eqn{i < j}
}
}
\note{
This function assumes that \code{i < j} for all input pairs. If \code{i > j}, the result
will be incorrect as it corresponds to the upper triangle, which is not stored
in \code{dist} objects. The function does not check for valid indices.
